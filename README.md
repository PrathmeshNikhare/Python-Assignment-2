# Python-Assignment-2
This repository contains assignment 2 from the TuteDude's python course.

# Task-1
>> We take an integer input from the user using the input() function.
>> Then using if-else statement we check the condition if the number gives remainder zero or not on dividing it by 2. This is accomplished through modulo (%) operator.
>> According to the condition is satisfied or not the print statements are executed.

# Task-2
>> We initialize a sum variable total to zero.
>> Then we run a for loop in python using 'in' operator and range() function.
>> We start the loop from 1 and run it till 50. We perform total = total + i operation in the loop.
>> At the end of the loop we get the required output.
